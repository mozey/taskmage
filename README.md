Started working on this before timewarrior was finished

Now using <s>taskwarrior, timewarrior and bugwarrior for TODOs and time tracking</s> [mozey/vim-timetracker](https://github.com/mozey/vim-timetracker)

note that some or all the code might be broken


# taskmage

Python command line TODO manager with time tracking using SQLite database
